Cookie-Clicker
==============

This is a very small Python script to click the cookie at http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/.


When this script runs, it will take the current mouse coordinates on the screen, and simulate a mouse click at that location every 50ms. 

The script only gets the script once, at the start. It also does not have any auto-end or auto-terminate feature. It will need to be ended via keyboard command.

To Use:
1) Place clickCookie.py in a folder of your choosing. 
2) Open http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieClicker in a web browser.
3) Open a command-line (eg. Terminal on OS X) and:
	$ cd /directory/that/contains/clickCookie.py
4) Move the mouse over the Cookie image on the cookie clicker web page.
5) Alt-Tab / Command-Tab back to the command-line and type:
	$ python clickCookie.py

To end the process press Crl+Z or Ctrl+Break.
